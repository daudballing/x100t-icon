Here is a Fujifilm icon set suitable for the x100 series (look in the png-folder for the icons)

The png icon sizes are completely random, so you might want to get them all and get rid of any unwanted sizes

You are free to use the icon in any way you want. You can copy, edit and share it in any way you'd likee

The icon is made with inspiration from Flickr.com where camera profile and image options shows a small icon to represent the camera of which the image was shot

Feel free to use this on your personal site, commercial site or any other site you can think of

This is not an official Fujifilm icon set
